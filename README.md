# landing-page-design-with-html-css-2

A simple website for donation or charity organization. 

I used inter, poppins and lobster font. I also used font-awesome icons. This is designed by HTML5 and CSS3. No CSS Framework used. This is not responsive design.

If you want the code you can happily use it. If you like this project then give a star rating.
