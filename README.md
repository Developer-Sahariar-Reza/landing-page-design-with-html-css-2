# landing-page-design-with-html-css-2

A simple website for donation or charity organization. 

I used inter, poppins and lobster font. I also used font-awesome. This is designed by HTML5 and CSS3. No CSS Framework used. 

If you want the code you can happily use it. If you like this project then give a star rating.
